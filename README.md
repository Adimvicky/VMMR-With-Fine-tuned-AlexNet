# Vehicle Make and Model Recognition with Fine-Tuned AlexNet

This project explores the effectiveness of fine-tuning AlexNet for vehicle make and model recognition using the Stanford Cars dataset. All training and evaluations were performed using `project_colab.ipynb` on Google Colab with GPU acceleration (A100). The final report is included in `report.pdf`.

## üß† Notebooks

- `project.ipynb`: Final version for grading and code review. Uses relative paths so it works in both local and Colab environments (if files are uploaded manually).
- `project_colab.ipynb`: Primary notebook used for training with Google Drive. Requires the dataset to be located at `drive/MyDrive/VehicleModelProject/dataset/`.


## üìä Evaluation Artifacts

All training diagnostics, loss curves, confusion matrices, and prediction analyses are saved in the `visualizations/` folder. These are referenced throughout the report and provide insight into the model‚Äôs learning behavior, error patterns, and classification performance.

## üìÑ Report

- `report.pdf`: Full technical report formatted in IEEE TPAMI style. Includes background, methodology, results, analysis, ablation studies, limitations, and future directions.
